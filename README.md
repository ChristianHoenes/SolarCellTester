# SolarCellTester

This repository contains some Arduino code files that were developed in 2022 in the context of a thesis (topic: measuring solar cells with school equipment).

1. Transistor-Cell-Tester
   - A field effect transistor is used as a variable load resistor. The IV-Curve is measured

2. OpAmp-Cell-Tester
   - The voltage is driven by an OpAmp. The IV-Curve is measured.
